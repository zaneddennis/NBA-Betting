This repo is mostly for personal use/experimentation so it's not as fully documented as my other publicly released stuff. However, I am leaving it public for now in case anyone who stumbles across here is curious what I'm working on these days outside of school and my job.

I do not actually place bets with money, I just track hypothetical performance of my algorithms both for fun and for practice.
